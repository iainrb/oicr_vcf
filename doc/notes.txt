TODO

- Read VCF file in chunks
- Keep running totals of quantities of interest
- Write in JSON format
- Use STDIN/STDOUT by default. Also support command line options.
- Need separate output file for each invididual. Default to individual_name.json, support other options

Questions

- deadline, if any?
- JSON format: is this reference->alternate->count?
